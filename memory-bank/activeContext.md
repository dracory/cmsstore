## Recent Changes
Investigated shortcode functionality. Determined that shortcodes are externally defined and registered, allowing for user-defined custom rendering logic.
Investigated multisite functionality. Confirmed multisite architecture implemented using Site struct and associated controllers for CRUD operations.  Each site can have multiple domains.
Investigated page functionality. Documented findings in `page_investigation.md`. Page management uses a well-defined data model, flexible querying, and a comprehensive admin interface. The system supports versioning and soft deletion of pages.
Investigated translation functionality.  Translations are managed as individual entities, supporting multiple languages.  The system uses placeholders for dynamic translation rendering.
Investigated menu functionality. Menus are managed as hierarchical structures using a tree-like data model.  The admin interface supports CRUD operations and filtering.
Added new sections to README.md for Blocks, Translations, and Menus, explaining their usage and benefits.
Added a new section to README.md detailing CMS URL patterns and their usage.
