## Project Overview

This project, Cms Store, is a modular Go-based content management system (CMS) designed for easy integration into existing Go applications. Unlike traditional CMSs requiring full installations, Cms Store can be added as a module dependency, simplifying updates and removal.  It's fully self-contained, requiring no additional packages or dependencies. Key features include multi-site support, templates, pages, blocks, menus, translations, custom entity types, middleware support, and widget support.
