# Progress

## Updated Files
- **`menu_query_interface.go`**: Added comprehensive comments to describe the purpose of each method in the `MenuQueryInterface`.
- **`site_query_interface.go`**: Added comments to document the purpose of each method in the `SiteQueryInterface`.

## Current Status
- The `MenuQueryInterface` and `SiteQueryInterface` methods are now well-documented, making it easier for other developers to understand and use the interfaces.

## Known Issues
- None identified at this time.

## Next Steps
- Continue documenting other files as needed.
- Review and update other interfaces and structs if additional documentation is required.
